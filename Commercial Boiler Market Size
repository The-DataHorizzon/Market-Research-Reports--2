The global digital signage market size was estimated at USD 24.86 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.0% from 2023 to 2030. This market growth is accredited to the increasing demand for the digitized promotion of products and services to attract the attention of the target audience in an effective manner. Furthermore, the demand for 4K digitized sign displays with embedded software and media player is rising as it offers customers an affordable Ultra HD digital signage solution, which is also expected to drive the demand. The evolution of innovative products, such as home monitoring systems, leak detector systems, and so on, along with complicated monetary products, such as forex cards, that need informative and succinct advertisement content are some of the factors that are predicted to drive the product demand.
